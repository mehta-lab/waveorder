# WaveOrder Demos

The demos in this folder illustrate image formation models and reconstruction algorithms using simulated data. Each demo illustrates image formation and reconstruction for a specific computational imaging method.

The demos are provided in two formats:

1. Python scripts with cell delimiters that can be run interactively using a local Python installation and an IDE such as vscode.
2. Jupyter Notebooks that can be run using Google Colab using the URL of following format.

## QPI (Quantitative Phase Imaging) from defocus
- [Python script](./QPI_defocus/QPI_defocus_simulation.py)
- [Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mehta-lab/waveorder/blob/demos-aqlm/docs/examples/demos/QPI_defocus/QPI_defocus_simulation.ipynb)

## QLIPP (Quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization)
- [Python script](./QLIPP/QLIPP_simulation.py)
- [Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mehta-lab/waveorder/blob/demos-aqlm/docs/examples/demos/QLIPP/QLIPP_simulation.ipynb)


## Developer notes:
- The notebooks are generated from the Python scripts using jupytext.
