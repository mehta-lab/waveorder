# Buyer's Guide

## Quantitative phase imaging:

You can use a transmitted light source (LED or a lamp) and a condenser commonly available on almost all microscopes. In addition to the transmitted light imaging path, you will need a motorized stage for acquiring through-focus image stacks.

## Quantitative polarization imaging (PolScope):

The following list of components assumes that you already have a transmitted light source (LED or a lamp) and a condenser.

Buyers have two options:
1. buy a complete hardware kit from the OpenPolScope project, or
2. assemble your own kit piece by piece.

### Buy a kit from the OpenPolScope project

- Read about the [OpenPolScope Hardware Kit](https://openpolscope.org/pages/OPS_Hardware.htm).
- Complete the [OpenPolScope information request form](https://openpolscope.org/pages/Info_Request_Form.htm).

### Buy individual components

The components are listed in the order in which they process light. See the build video here to see how to assemble these components on your microscope.

| Part                     | Approximate Price | Notes                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Illumination filter | $200 | We suggest [a Thorlabs CWL = 530 nm, FWHM = 10 nm notch filter](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=FBH530-10).|
| Circular polarizer | $350 | We suggest [a Thorlabs 532 nm, left-hand circular polarizer](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=CP1L532).|
| Liquid crystal compensator | $6,000 | Meadowlark optics LVR-42x52mm-VIS-ASSY or LVR-50x60mm-VIS-POL-ASSY. Although near-variants are listed in the [Meadowlowlark catalog](https://www.meadowlark.com/product/liquid-crystal-variable-retarder/), this is a custom part with two liquid crystals in a custom housing. [Contact Meadowlark](https://www.meadowlark.com/contact-us/) for a quote.|
| Liquid crystal control electronics | $2,000 | [Meadowlark optics D5020-20V](https://www.meadowlark.com/product/liquid-crystal-digital-interface-controller/). Choose the high-voltage 20V version.
| Liquid crystal adapter | $25-$500 | A 3D printed part that aligns the liquid crystal compensator in a microscope stand's illumination path. Check for your stand among the [OpenPolScope `.stl` files](https://github.com/amitabhverma/Microscope-LC-adapters/tree/main/stl_files) or [contact us](compmicro@czbiohub.org) for more options.|
| Circular analyzer (opposite handedness) | $350 | We suggest [a Thorlabs 532 nm, right-hand circular polarizer](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=CP1R532).|

## Quantitative phase and polarization imaging (QLIPP):

Combining the Z-stage and the PolScope components listed above enables joint phase and polarization imaging with `waveorder`.
