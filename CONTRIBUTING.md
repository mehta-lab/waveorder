# Contributing guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `waveorder`!

Please see the following steps for our workflow.

## Getting started

Please read the [README](./README.md) for an overview of the project,
and how you can install and use the package.

## Issues

We use [issues](https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/issues) to track
bug reports, feature requests, and provide user support.

Before opening a new issue, please first search existing issues (including closed ones),
to see if there is an existing discussion about it.

### Setting up development environment

For local development, first install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
and Python with an environment management tool
(e.g. [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), a minimal community distribution of Conda).

If you use Conda, set up an environment with:

```sh
conda create -n waveorder-dev python=3.10
conda activate waveorder-dev
```

If you have push permission to the repository,
clone the repository (the code blocks below are shell commands):

```sh
cd # to the directory you want to work in
git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder.git
```

Otherwise, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
to [fork](https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/fork) the repository.

Then install the package in editable mode with the development dependencies:

```sh
cd waveorder/ # or the renamed project root directory
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then make the changes and [track them with Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git#example-contribute-to-an-existing-repository).


### Code style

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to sort imports with [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and format code with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) automatically prior to each commit. To minimize test errors when submitting pull requests, please install pre-commit in your environment as follows:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

When these packages are executed within the project root directory, they should automatically use the [project settings](./pyproject.toml).
