Label-agnostic computational microscopy of architectural order. 

# Overview

`waveorder` is a generalist framework for label-agnostic computational microscopy of architectural order, i.e., density, alignment, and orientation of biomolecules with a resolution down to the diffraction limit. The framework implements wave-optical simulations and corresponding reconstruction algorithms for diverse label-free and fluorescence computational imaging methods that enable large-scale image-based profiling of dynamic cell systems. Our goal is to provide unified, accurate, modular, and user-friendly implementations of computational microscopy methods for dynamic imaging across the scales of organelles, cells, and tissues. 


The framework is described in the following [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09775).

# Computational Microscopy Methods

The key feature of `waveorder` is that it provides a unified interface for simulating and reconstructing data for many one-photon (single-scattering based) computational microscopy methods, summarized below.

## Label-free microscopy

### Quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization (QLIPP)

Acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of QLIPP are described in the following [E-Life Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502):

### Permittivity tensor imaging (PTI)

PTI provides volumetric reconstructions of mean permittivity ($\propto$ material density), differential permittivity ($\propto$ material anisotropy), 3D orientation, and optic sign. The following figure summarizes PTI acquisition and reconstruction with a small optical section of the mouse brain tissue:

The acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of PTI are described in the following [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422951) published in Nature Methods:

## Installation

Create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -y -n waveorder python=3.10
conda activate waveorder
```

Install `waveorder` from PyPI:

```sh
pip install waveorder
```

(Optional) Install all visualization dependencies (napari, jupyter), clone the repository, and run an example script:
```sh
pip install waveorder[all]
git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder.git
python waveorder/examples/models/phase_thick_3d.py
```

(M1 users) `pytorch` has [incomplete GPU support](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/77764),
so please use `export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`
to allow some operators to fallback to CPU if you plan to use GPU acceleration for polarization reconstruction. 


## Examples
The [examples](https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/tree/main/docs/examples) illustrate simulations and reconstruction for 2D QLIPP, 3D phase from brightfield, and 2D/3D PTI methods.

If you are interested in deploying QLIPP or phase from brightbrield, or fluorescence deconvolution for label-agnostic imaging at scale, checkout our [napari plugin](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/recOrder-napari),  [`recOrder-napari`](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder).
