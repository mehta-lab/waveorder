This computational imaging library enables wave-optical simulation and reconstruction of optical properties that report microscopic architectural order.

## Computational label-free imaging

This vectorial wave simulator and reconstructor enabled the development of a new label-free imaging method, __permittivity tensor imaging (PTI)__, that measures density and  3D orientation of biomolecules with diffraction-limited resolution. These measurements are reconstructed from polarization-resolved images acquired with a sequence of oblique illuminations.

The acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of PTI are described in the following [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422951):

 ```

In addition to PTI, `waveorder` enables simulations and reconstructions of subsets of label-free measurements with subsets of the acquired data:

1. Reconstruction of 2D or 3D phase, projected retardance, and in-plane orientation from a polarization-diverse volumetric brightfield acquisition ([QLIPP](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502))

2. Reconstruction of 2D or 3D phase from a volumetric brightfield acquisition ([2D](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-54-28-8566)/[3D (PODT)](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-57-1-a205) phase)

3. Reconstruction of 2D or 3D phase from an illumination-diverse volumetric acquisition ([2D](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-23-9-11394&id=315599)/[3D](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-10-3940&id=349951) differential phase contrast)

PTI provides volumetric reconstructions of mean permittivity ($\propto$ material density), differential permittivity ($\propto$ material anisotropy), 3D orientation, and optic sign. The following figure summarizes PTI acquisition and reconstruction with a small optical section of the mouse brain tissue:

The [example notebooks](https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/tree/main/examples) illustrate simulations and reconstruction for 2D QLIPP, 3D PODT, and 2D/3D PTI methods.

If you are interested in deploying QLIPP or PODT for label-free imaging at scale, checkout our [napari plugin](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/recOrder-napari),  [`recOrder-napari`](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder).

## Correlative imaging

In addition to label-free reconstruction algorithms, `waveorder` also implements widefield fluorescence and fluorescence polarization reconstruction algorithms for correlative label-free and fluorescence imaging.

1. Correlative measurements of biomolecular density and orientation from polarization-diverse widefield imaging ([multimodal Instant PolScope](https://opg.optica.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-13-5-3102&id=472350))

We provide an [example notebook](https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/blob/main/examples/experimental_reconstructions/fluorescence_deconvolution/fluorescence_deconv.ipynb) for widefield fluorescence deconvolution.

## Installation

(Optional but recommended) install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -y -n waveorder python=3.9
conda activate waveorder
```

Install `waveorder` from PyPI:

```sh
pip install waveorder
```

Use `waveorder` in your scripts:

```sh
python
>>> import waveorder
```

(Optional) Download the repository, install `jupyter`, and experiment with the example notebooks

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder.git
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook ./waveorder/examples/
```

(Optional) Use NVIDIA GPUs by installing `cupy` with [these instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html). Check that `cupy` is properly installed with

```sh
python
>>> import cupy
```

To use GPUs in `waveorder` set ```use_gpu=True``` when initializing the simulator and reconstructor classes.
