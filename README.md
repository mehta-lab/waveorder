This package enables wave-optical simulation and reconstruction of optical properties that report microscopic architectural order. 

`waveorder` supported the development of a new label-free imaging method, __uniaxial permittivity tensor imaging (uPTI)__, that reconstructs density (phase) and 3D anisotropy (principal retardance, 3D orientation of the optic axis, and optic sign) of specimens from polarization-resolved images acquired under a sequence of oblique illuminations.

The acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of uPTI are described in the following [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422951):

uPTI provides volumetric reconstructions of phase, principal retardance, 3D orientation, and optic sign from a polarization- and illumination-diverse acquisition. The following figure summarizes uPTI acquisitions and reconstructions with simulated phantoms:

In addition to uPTI, `waveorder` also enables simulation and reconstruction of subsets of label-free measurements from subsets of the acquired data: 

1. Reconstruction of 2D or 3D phase, projected retardance, and in-plane orientation from a polarization-diverse volumetric brightfield acquisition ([QLIPP](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502))

2. Reconstruction of 2D or 3D phase from a volumetric brightfield acquisition ([2D](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-54-28-8566)/[3D (PODT)](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-57-1-a205) phase)
    
3. Reconstruction of 2D or 3D phase from an illumination-diverse volumetric acquisition ([2D](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-23-9-11394&id=315599)/[3D](https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-7-10-3940&id=349951) differential phase contrast)

The [example notebooks](examples/) contain simulations and reconstructions for 2D QLIPP, 3D PODT, and 2D/3D uPTI.

## Quick Start

(Optional but recommended) install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -y -n waveorder python=3.9
conda activate waveorder
```
Install `waveorder` from PyPI:

```sh
pip install waveorder
```
Use `waveorder` in your scripts:
```sh
python
>>> import waveorder
```

(Optional) Download the repository, install `jupyter`, and experiment with the example notebooks
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder.git
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook ./waveorder/examples/
```

(Optional) Use NVIDIA GPUs by installing `cupy` with [these instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html). Check that `cupy` is properly installed with
```sh
python
>>> import cupy
```
To use GPUs in `waveorder` set ```use_gpu=True``` when initializing the simulator and reconstructor classes.
