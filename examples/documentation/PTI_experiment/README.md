The notebooks in this folder require data from this source:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1063

One notebook `PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.ipynb` will run as is with the latest version of the code and a ~500 MB download from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/files/S-BIAD1063/PTI-BIA/Anisotropic_target_small.zip.

The remaining notebooks are not maintained, so they will require a download and an old version of this repository from https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/tree/1.0.0b0.
