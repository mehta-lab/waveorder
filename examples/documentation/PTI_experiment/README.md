# PTI reconstructions

The demos in this folder illustrate reconstruction algorithm for permittivity tensor imaging (PTI). The main demo script is [PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.py](PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.py), which illustrates reconstruction of the permittivity tensor of an anisotropic glass target. The reconstructed results are rendered as PDF file [PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.pdf](PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.pdf).

The remaining notebooks illustrate the reconstruction of permittivity tensor of cells and tissues. However they are not maintained and require an old version of this repository from https://github.com/mehta-lab/waveorder/tree/1.0.0b0.

The scripts and notebooks in this folder require data from the image data repository:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1063

The demo script [PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.py](PTI_Experiment_Recon3D_anisotropic_target_small.py) will run as is with the latest version of the code and a ~500 MB download from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/files/S-BIAD1063/PTI-BIA/Anisotropic_target_small.zip.
