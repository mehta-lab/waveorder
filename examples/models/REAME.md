This folder of `models` examples consists of a set of simulations that are begin actively developed and will run as is. 

Each model is named with the schema `<sample-angular-assumptions>_<sample-spatial-assumptions>_<data-shape>`. 

For example, `isotropic_thin_3d.py` demonstrates a set of methods for simulating and reconstructing 
- an isotropic object (i.e. an attenuating-phase object that has no diattenuation or birefringence) that is
- thin compared to the depth of field of the microscope from
-  three-dimensional data (a defocus stack).
