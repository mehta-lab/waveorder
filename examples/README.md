`waveorder` is undergoing a significant refactor, and this `examples/` folder serves as a good place to understand the current state of the repository.

Some examples require `pip install waveorder[examples]` for `napari` and `jupyter`. Visit the [napari installation guide](https://napari.org/dev/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) if napari installation fails.
